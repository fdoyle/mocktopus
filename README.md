=========

This thing isn't done yet, don't look at it!


todo:

add a "real" api (maybe a weather api?)

add config activity

add dagger stuff for proper injection of components
add annotation parsing functionality
add List support
add more object support (support filling out Integer, Double, etc)
add primitives support (just use objects for now?)
add Map support (not uncommon with gson)
add recursive child limits (if MyObject contains a MyObject, tries to add more forever. depth limit?)
generics support

more annotations?


add some flavors to show how to use next to a "real" api

long-term to-do
code generation instead of runtime?
