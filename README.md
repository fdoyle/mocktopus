=========

This thing isn't done yet, don't look at it!


todo:

add a "real" api (maybe a weather api?)

add config activity

add dagger stuff for proper injection of components
add annotation parsing functionality
add List support
add more object support
add primitives support (just use objects for now?)
add Map support



add some flavors to show how to use next to a "real" api

long-term to-do
code generation instead of runtime?
